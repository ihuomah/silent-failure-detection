## Day 1 – Hardware Baseline Verification

- Board: Arduino UNO R4 WiFi
- Connection: USB (Serial)
- Port: COM3
- Baud rate: 115200
- Heartbeat interval: ~10 seconds
- Output: Sequential heartbeat counter printed to Serial Monitor

Result:
Baseline heartbeat generation is stable and reliable. This confirms hardware readiness for networked heartbeat transmission.

Next step:
Transmit heartbeat over Wi-Fi via a controlled network (phone hotspot) and begin logging on the laptop.
