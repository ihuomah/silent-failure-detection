# Day 5 – Forensic Reconstruction and Security Validation

## Purpose
Day 5 focuses on reconstructing outage events using available telemetry while explicitly separating evidence, indicators, and unknowns.
The goal is not to attribute cause, but to constrain what can be reliably stated from the data.

---

## Evidence Available

The following facts are from collected telemetry:
- Source IP address
- Downtime start and end timestamps
- Duration of telemetry silence
- Sequence number before outage
- Sequence number after recovery
- Sequence delta
- Threshold breach confirmation

These values form the factual basis for reconstruction.

---

## Reconstruction Summary
During observed outage windows, telemetry from the monitored device ceased and later resumed. 
Sequence continuity was broken, and in some cases sequence counters reset. 
This confirms loss of observability and disruption of telemetry continuity.

---

## Indicators Observed
- Extended silence exceeding defined thresholds
- Negative sequence deltas indicating counter resets
- Large sequence gaps suggesting missed heartbeats

These indicators suggest possible causes but do not confirm intent or mechanism.

---

## Unknowns and Limitations
With the current data, it is not possible to determine:
- Whether the outage was caused by network failure, reboot, power loss, or attack
- Whether system state changed during the silence window
- Whether recovered telemetry reflects a trusted or altered state

These unknowns are explicitly documented rather than assumed away.

---

## Security Implications
Silent outages create periods where system behaviour cannot be verified. 
Even after recovery, trust must be reassessed, as normal telemetry does not guarantee integrity.

This reconstruction approach supports incident response, audit preparation, and risk assessment by preventing false certainty.
